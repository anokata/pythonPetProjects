70 #Define a function overlapping() that takes two lists and returns True if they have at least one member in common, False otherwise. You may use your is_member() function, or the in operator, but for the sake of the exercise, you should (also) write it using two nested for-loops.

78 #Define a function generate_n_chars() that takes an integer n and a character c and returns a string, n characters long, consisting only of c:s. For example, generate_n_chars(5,"x") should return the string "xxxxx". (Python is unusual in that you can actually write an expression 5 * "x" that will evaluate to "xxxxx". For the sake of the exercise you should ignore that the problem can be solved in this manner.)

172 #In cryptography, a Caesar cipher is a very simple encryption techniques in which each letter in the plain text is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, A would be replaced by D, B would become E, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it to communicate with his generals. ROT-13 ("rotate by 13 places") is a widely used example of a Caesar cipher where the shift is 13. In Python, the key for ROT-13 may be represented by means of the following dictionary:

370 #Write a program able to play the "Guess the number"-game, where the number to be guessed is randomly chosen between 1 and 20. (Source: http://inventwithpython.com) This is how it should work when run in a terminal:

372 #>>> import guess_number
373 #Hello! What is your name?
374 #Torbjörn
375 #Well, Torbjörn, I am thinking of a number between 1 and 20.

385 #An anagram is a type of word play, the result of rearranging the letters of a word or phrase to produce a new word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once; e.g., orchestra = carthorse, A decimal point = I'm a dot in place. Write a Python program that, when started 1) randomly picks a word w from given list of words, 2) randomly permutes w (thus creating an anagram of w), 3) presents the anagram to the user, and 4) enters an interactive loop in which the user is invited to guess the original word. It may be a good idea to work with (say) colour words only. The interaction with the program may look like so:
386 #
387 #>>> import anagram
388 #Colour word anagram: onwbr
389 #Guess the colour word!
390 #black
391 #Guess the colour word!
392 #brown
393 #Correct!
394 #In a game of Lingo, there is a hidden word, five characters long. The object of the game is to find this word by guessing, and in return receive two kinds of clues: 1) the characters that are fully correct, with respect to identity as well as to position, and 2) the characters that are indeed present in the word, but which are placed in the wrong position. Write a program with which one can play Lingo. Use square brackets to mark characters correct in the sense of 1), and ordinary parentheses to mark characters correct in the sense of 2). Assuming, for example, that the program conceals the word "tiger", you should be able to interact with it in the following way:
395 #
396 #>>> import lingo
397 #snake
398 #Clue: snak(e)
399 #fiest
400 #Clue: f[i](e)s(t)
401 #times
402 #Clue: [t][i]m[e]s
403 #tiger
404 #Clue: [t][i][g][e][r]

408 #A sentence splitter is a program capable of splitting a text into sentences. The standard set of heuristics for sentence splitting includes (but isn't limited to) the following rules:
409 #
410 #Sentence boundaries occur at one of "." (periods), "?" or "!", except that
411 #
412 #Periods followed by whitespace followed by a lower case letter are not sentence boundaries.
413 #Periods followed by a digit with no intervening whitespace are not sentence boundaries.
414 #Periods followed by whitespace and then an upper case letter, but preceded by any of a short list of titles are not sentence boundaries. Sample titles include Mr., Mrs., Dr., and so on.
415 #Periods internal to a sequence of letters with no adjacent whitespace are not sentence boundaries (for example, www.aptex.com, or e.g).
416 #Periods followed by certain kinds of punctuation (notably comma and more periods) are probably not sentence boundaries.
417 #Your task here is to write a program that given the name of a text file is able to write its content with each sentence on a separate line. Test your program with the following short text: Mr. Smith bought cheapsite.com for 1.5 million dollars, i.e. he paid a lot for it. Did he mind? Adam Jones Jr. thinks he didn't. In any case, this isn't true... Well, with a probability of .9 it isn't. The result should be:

419 #Mr. Smith bought cheapsite.com for 1.5 million dollars, i.e. he paid a lot for it.
420 #Did he mind?

424 #An anagram is a type of word play, the result of rearranging the letters of a word or phrase to produce a new word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once; e.g., orchestra = carthorse. Using the word list at http://www.puzzlers.org/pub/wordlists/unixdict.txt, write a program that finds the sets of words that share the same characters that contain the most words in them.

426 #Your task in this exercise is as follows:
427 #
428 #Generate a string with N opening brackets ("[") and N closing brackets ("]"), in some arbitrary order.
429 #Determine whether the generated string is balanced; that is, whether it consists entirely of pairs of opening/closing brackets (in that order), none of which mis-nest.
430 #Examples:
431 #
432 #   []        OK   ][        NOT OK
433 #   [][]      OK   ][][      NOT OK
434 #   [[][]]    OK   []][[]    NOT OK
435 #A certain childrens game involves starting with a word in a particular category. Each participant in turn says a word, but that word must begin with the final letter of the previous word. Once a word has been given, it cannot be repeated. If an opponent cannot give a word in the category, they fall out of the game. For example, with "animals" as the category,
436 #
437 #Child 1: dog 
438 #Child 2: goldfish
439 #Child 1: hippopotamus
440 #Child 2: snake
441 #...
442 #Your task in this exercise is as follows: Take the following selection of 70 English Pokemon names (extracted from Wikipedia's list of Pokemon) and generate the/a sequence with the highest possible number of Pokemon names where the subsequent name starts with the final letter of the preceding name. No Pokemon name is to be repeated.

452 #An alternade is a word in which its letters, taken alternatively in a strict sequence, and used in the same order as the original word, make up at least two other words. All letters must be used, but the smaller words are not necessarily of the same length. For example, a word with seven letters where every second letter is used will produce a four-letter word and a three-letter word. Here are two examples:
453 #
454 #  "board": makes "bad" and "or".
455 #  "waists": makes "wit" and "ass".
456 #Using the word list at http://www.puzzlers.org/pub/wordlists/unixdict.txt, write a program that goes through each word in the list and tries to make two smaller words using every second letter. The smaller words must also be members of the list. Print the words to the screen in the above fashion.
